Classic examples merged the Western genre with 'hippy' ideals and political satire peppered with surrealism, psychedelia and absurdity. This resulted in some of the most memorable exercises of transgressive cinema; marrying trash and high art with a Western setting. Prime examples include the notorious ""El Topo"" by Alejandro Jodorowsky and ""Greaser's Palace"" by Robert Downey.
